**Online Retail Application - Java Project**
This repository contains a Java project that implements an online retail application with a database using file handling. The project is designed to run on the Apache NetBeans IDE and provides separate login functionality for both admins and users.
**Project Overview**
The online retail application project aims to create a user-friendly interface for admins and users to interact with the system. The application utilizes file handling in Java to implement a product database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Admin Features**
**Admin login:** The admin can log in to the system using their credentials, granting them access to the administrative features.
**Product management:** The admin has the ability to add new products, delete existing products, update product details, and view all products in the database.

**User Features**
**User login:** Users can log in to the system using their credentials, allowing them to access user-specific functionalities.
**Order placement:** Users can browse the available products and place orders. After placing an order, they receive a receipt for their purchase.
**Order history:** Users can view their past orders and track their order history.
**Product browsing:** Users can view the list of available products in the database.

The project ensures efficient and secure handling of user and admin data, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the system's features. The use of file handling in Java provides a convenient and secure method for managing product orders and maintaining the product database.
